// The agent's permission boundary.
//
// Aether reads attacker-controlled text by design: web pages, WHOIS records,
// profile bios, EXIF fields belonging to whoever it is investigating. Anything
// in that text can try to instruct the model. So the question is not "will the
// model be told to do something bad" — it will be — but "what happens when it
// is". This module is the answer.
//
// This is one of four layers, and it is the only one that is ours:
//
//   1. OS sandbox      seatbelt / bubblewrap, enabled in agent.ts. Kernel-
//                      enforced. The only layer a clever string cannot talk
//                      its way past.
//   2. Read boundary   blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories, enforced by the
//                      SDK in every permission mode.
//   3. This policy     a path boundary, a credential deny-list, an autonomy
//                      gate, and fail-closed on anything unparseable.
//   4. Tool removal    safe mode strips the mutating tools from the model's
//                      context entirely, so they cannot be called at all.
//
// Layer 3 exists because layers 1 and 2 do not know what Aether considers
// sensitive, and because Bash arguments are opaque to both. Its shell
// inspection is best-effort by construction — a determined injection can
// obfuscate a path — so it is a speed bump above the sandbox, never the
// thing standing between the user and a hostile web page.
//
// Every decision here is enforced through the SDK's `canUseTool` callback,
// which is ONLY consulted when the session is not in bypassPermissions mode.
// That is why agent.ts no longer sets it: under that flag this file is dead
// code and the app silently has no policy at all.

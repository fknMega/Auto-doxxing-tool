// Modules are grouped by the QUESTION they answer, not by how they are
// implemented. A user looking for subdomain enumeration is not thinking "I want
// an http module" — and grouping by readiness instead would make rows jump
// between sections as things install, which is disorienting on the one screen
// whose job is to be legible.
//
// Anything unmapped falls into "Other", so a new bundled module shows up rather
// than disappearing.
